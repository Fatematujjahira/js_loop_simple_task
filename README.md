# js_loop_simple_task

It is fun working with codes.
But I think it is not done yet. There is more and more.
Like I just add an example about for loop using statement using `in` operator.
There is more you can use `of` operator in javascript.
As well, I add the 4th example as a task on my repository you can try it later.

Good luck.
